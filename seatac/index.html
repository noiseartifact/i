      <p>
        I love this weird little corner of the seattle-tacoma international
        airport.

        It's like an industrial-themed Narnia for introverts; follow inscrutable
        directions to its entrance (signs for gates D21 - D26, marked with
        arrows but not illuminated), pass through a magical portal (a narrow,
        dirty hallway lined with benches filled with sleeping travelers), and
        suddenly you're in another world.

      <div id="starbucks">
        <p>
          The first thing you see is a Starbucks (of course you do). This
          Starbucks is closed after 1pm, a strong hint that this world is
          entirely unlike the one you left behind.

      <div id="hangar">
        <p>
          The area itself resembles an old air hangar cut in half, all
          corrugated steel and pipes, softened by wooden slats holding up the
          roof.

        <p>
          Oddly, there are no airplanes in sight through the large windows
          (punctuated by air ducts) â€“ the gates lead to buses that carry their
          passengers to some other (mysterious) location.
